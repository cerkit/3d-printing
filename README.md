# 3d-printing
This is where I store all of my design files for my 3D models

All of these files are licensed with a BSD license. Mostly because I was granted a BSD license from [Printable Scenery](https://www.printablescenery.com/) to use their OpenLOCK™ technology as the basis of my tiles.

I also have a [DRAGONBITE™](http://www.fatdragongames.com/fdgfiles/?p=4240) license, but they have fewer templates available.

You can get the OpenLOCK™ clip from the [free templates file](https://www.printablescenery.com/product/open-lock/) on the Printable Scenery website.

I also designed and created a system that allows you to use 3/16" foam board with OpenLOCK™. These templates are available under the stl folder.

I print these on an Ender 3 Pro with a 60° bed and a 200° nozzle temperature. I do not use any supports and I use a 10% infill. There is no bed adhesion other than a skirt.

Basically, I use the default Cura profile with a 10% infill.

These take ~1.5 hours to print.

You can learn how to make these for yourself by reading my [blog post](https://cerkit.com/2018/12/24/3d-printed-terrain/) or watching the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/mtQGg3wtoMk).
